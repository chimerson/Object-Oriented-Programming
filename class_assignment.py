#Write a class called Product. The class should have fields called name, amount, and price, holding the productâ€™s name, the number of items of that product in stock, and the regular price of the product. There should be a method get_price that receives the number of items to be bought and returns a the cost of buying that many items, where the regular price is charged for orders of less than 10 items, a 10% discount is applied for orders of between 10 and 99 items, and a 20% discount is applied for orders of 100 or more items. There should also be a method called make_purchase that receives the number of items to be bought and decreases amount by that much

class Product:
    def __init__(self, name, amount, price):
        self._name = name
        self._amount = amount
        self._price = price

    def get_price(self, amount2):
        if amount2 < 10:
            return amount2*self._price
        elif amount2 <=99:
            return (self._price - (10*self._price)/100) * amount2
        else:
            return (self._price - (20*self._price)/100) * amount2
            
    def make_purchase(self, amount3): 
        self._amount -= amount3


    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return 'The price of what you want to buy is ${}'.format(self._price)        

if __name__ == '__main__':
    marketing = Product('Piano', 7, 100)
    print(marketing.get_price(100))
